            clive-utils installation

 Normally you can do "make install". This will install the scripts
 in your own ~/bin/ directory. If you want to do a global install,
 you can do (as root):

    # make prefix=/usr install

 The manual pages are installed by default, if you do not need them:

    # make WITH_MAN=no install

 When you uninstall, be sure to use the same prefix. For example:

    # make prefix=/usr uninstall

 Developers may also find the following make target useful:

    man # generate clive.1 from clive (req. pod2man)
